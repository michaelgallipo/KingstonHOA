						<h2>History</h2>
						<p>
							The land was originally a grapefruit orchard, as was much of north central Phoenix.  
							Stamen Thomas was the well known mid-century builder. Homes are block but filled, which is unusual.
							There were three basic floor plans: a two story, two bedroom and three bedroom. Like today, 
							if you bought as they were built, you could choose finishes and make some physical changes. Most 
							people chose saltillo tile flooring which was very "in" at the time. There was an abandoned alley 
							on the north so those homes eventually split the alley with the homes on Cavalier Dr.  
							6045 N 10th Place was originally the construction office and had direct access to 10th St.  
							The strip of land between 10th St and the western wall of Kingswood was offered to Kingswood 
							but not purchased and was divided and sold to the four houses that front 10th St. now. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The original three model homes were the ones that now back to Bethany Home but all faced the road
							at that time.  Over the years, as Bethany Home became busier, they reversed and the "fronts" became the 
							"backs".  As of 2021, there are two original owner residents.

							<h2>The Neighborhood</h2>
							<p>
								Uptown is an area centered on Central Avenue north of downtown Phoenix. 
								The boundaries are roughly Camelback Ave to Bethany Home and 16th St. to 7th Ave. 
								It incorporates three historic districts: Medlock Place, Windsor Square and Pierson Place.
							</p>
							<p>
								It includes many older ranch style, single family homes, bistros, restaurants, apartments, 
								condominiums, shops, a large farmer&#39;s market, excellent private and public schools and
								several patio and town home complexes. Kingswood is one of the latter, tucked away on a
								private cul de sac, just north of Bethany Home and east of 7th St.

              <p>
                Kingswood is centrally located between the fashionable bistros on Central Ave and 16th St and only three
                blocks from the principal restaurant corridor of 7th Street.
              </p>
              <p>
                More than a dozen new restaurants have opened on 7th Street between Camelback and Glendale since
                2013 making it one of the fastest growing culinary hot spots in the city. Many of these new venues
                have made attarctive use of renovated midcentury buildings.
